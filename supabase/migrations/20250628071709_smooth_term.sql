  # Fix Infinite Recursion in Deck Policies

  1. Problem
    - Infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "deck_members"
    - Circular dependency between decks and deck_members policies
    - Query for decks with member count fails with 500 error

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing policies on both tables
    - Create new simplified policies that avoid circular references
    - Ensure proper access control without recursion
