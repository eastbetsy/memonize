  1. Database Changes
    - No schema changes needed

  2. Solution

    - This migration is just a marker to track that the issue was addressed
    - The fix is implemented in the RoomMusicPlayer component by changing .single() to .maybeSingle()
*/

-- This is a marker migration to document the fix
-- The actual fix is in the RoomMusicPlayer.tsx frontend component
-- No database changes are needed
